==================================
Code source for an android app that I have built during my learning of android pagination3 and Room.

This is an android app that fetch news articles from internet and display them in three Fragments.
The first fragment display breaking News, The second display the articles marked as favorites, the third give the user the ability 
to search for news by taping a query.
